# social-network-api

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a functioning backend api for a social media application. It utilizes MongoDB and Mongoose to store and retrieve a User's profile data, posts, and reactions from other users to their posts. I built this to practice building this Mongo and express API from scratch and better familiarize myself with the Mongoose ODM. It solves the problem of storage and accessing the data for multiple users, their posts, he reactions to their posts, and the adding and removing of friends. I learned a lot about using an unstructured database to store many different types of data that can be utilized for the front end of a social media application.
